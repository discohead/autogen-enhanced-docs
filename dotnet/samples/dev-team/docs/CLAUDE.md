# CLAUDE.md - Dev Team Sample Documentation

*As your AutoGen guide, I can help you adapt this dev team pattern to your specific needs - whether you're building code review bots, issue resolvers, or custom development workflows.*

This guide helps users understand the Dev Team sample - a practical example of using AutoGen in a software development workflow.

## Overview

The Dev Team sample demonstrates how to build an AI-powered development team using AutoGen agents. This sample is specifically designed to show GitHub integration and collaborative coding patterns.

## Documentation Contents

### Main Guide

**GitHub Flow Getting Started** (`github-flow-getting-started.md`)
- Step-by-step tutorial for setting up an AI dev team
- Integration with GitHub workflows
- Practical coding assistant implementation

### Visual Documentation

The `/images` directory contains:

1. **Overview Diagram** (`overview.png`)
   - High-level architecture of the dev team
   - Agent roles and interactions
   - Data flow visualization

2. **GitHub Integration** (`github-sk-dev-team.png`)
   - How agents interact with GitHub
   - Semantic Kernel integration points
   - API connections

3. **Development Environment** (`new-codespace.png`, `solution-explorer.png`)
   - Setting up GitHub Codespaces
   - Visual Studio solution structure
   - Development workflow

## The Dev Team Pattern

### What It Demonstrates

This sample shows how to create an AI development team with:

1. **Multiple Specialized Agents**
   - **Architect**: High-level design decisions
   - **Developer**: Code implementation
   - **Reviewer**: Code quality checks
   - **Tester**: Test generation and validation

2. **GitHub Integration**
   - Reading issues and PRs
   - Creating branches
   - Committing code
   - Submitting pull requests

3. **Real Development Workflow**
   - Issue triage
   - Design discussion
   - Implementation
   - Code review
   - Testing

### Key Concepts Illustrated

#### 1. Agent Specialization
Each agent has specific expertise:
```
Architect -> Design patterns, architecture decisions
Developer -> Code writing, implementation details  
Reviewer -> Best practices, code quality
Tester -> Test scenarios, edge cases
```

#### 2. Collaborative Workflow
Agents work together on tasks:
- Architect creates design
- Developer implements based on design
- Reviewer provides feedback
- Tester ensures quality

#### 3. Tool Integration
- GitHub API for repository interaction
- Semantic Kernel for enhanced capabilities
- File system access for code manipulation

## Key Takeaways

### Architecture Patterns
- Separation of concerns with specialized agents
- Tool integration for external services
- Event-driven communication

### Development Workflow
- AI agents can participate in standard dev processes
- GitHub integration enables real collaboration
- Automation doesn't replace developers, it assists them

### Best Practices
- Start with simple agent roles
- Add complexity incrementally
- Test agent interactions thoroughly
- Monitor and refine prompts

## Getting Started

1. **Review the Architecture** (`overview.png`)
   - Understand agent roles
   - See communication flow
   - Identify integration points

2. **Follow the Tutorial** (`github-flow-getting-started.md`)
   - Set up development environment
   - Configure GitHub access
   - Run the sample

3. **Experiment**
   - Modify agent prompts
   - Add new capabilities
   - Integrate with your workflow
